#Python decorator is special function that takes original function as argument
# extent its behaviour return modified behaviour without changing its orginal defination

# for loop and while loop
# for loop iterates overs iterables inline list set dict
# while loop iterates until condition is false
# Polymorphism= poly means many and morphism means appearances
  # its like same thing works differently based on context
  # + => we can use it for add as well as to concatenate

# Python garbage collection: Python uses automatic garbage collection
# in Python values are passed by references
# if mutable arg is passed it can be modified
# immutable objects will not be modified

#lambda=> lambda function is single line function, we can say it is as temp function
